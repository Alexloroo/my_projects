## Introduction
Hi! In this repository, I will present my pet projects and projects from competitions.

All the data in these projects is either from the competitions that allowed me to use the data or from open sources.

[Forecast of Aftershocks](https://github.com/Alexloroo/my_projects/tree/d057149e491402af5ced367c7e6834da61ca7d5e/Forecast-of-aftershock) | Using the data of the first earthquake shock, it is necessary to calculate the location, time and strength of the first aftershock. This project took the 5th place in the "KBTU Data Camp 2025". | Pandas, Tensorflow, Numpy, Matpotlib


## Tools
The main tools that I used in the project:
* The Python programming language;
  + machine learning library  [sklearn](https://www.sklearn.org/);
  + libraries for deep learning [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/);
  + libraries for data analysis and processing [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/),  [SciPy](https://scipy.org/);
  + library for data visualization [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/);
* programming environments [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/);
